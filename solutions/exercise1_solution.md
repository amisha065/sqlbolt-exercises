# SQL Lesson 1: SELECT queries 101

## Problem Statement

This exercise focuses on retrieving data using `SELECT` queries to extract different sets of information.

## Explanation
To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write SELECT statements, which are often colloquially refered to as *queries*.

And given a table of data, the most basic query we could write would be one that selects for a couple columns (properties) of the table with all the rows (instances).

- Select query for a specific columns
```
SELECT column, another_column, â€¦
FROM mytable;
```
