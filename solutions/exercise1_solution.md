# Exercise 1: SQL SELECT Queries

## Problem Statement

This exercise focuses on retrieving data from the `movies` table in an SQLite database. You are required to use `SELECT` queries to extract different sets of information.

## Explanation
To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write SELECT statements, which are often colloquially refered to as *queries*.

And given a table of data, the most basic query we could write would be one that selects for a couple columns (properties) of the table with all the rows (instances).

- Select query for a specific columns
```
SELECT column, another_column, â€¦
FROM mytable;
```

### Tasks

1. Find the `title` of each film.
2. Find the `director` of each film.
3. Find the `title` and `director` of each film.
4. Find the `title` and `year` of each film.
5. Find all the information about each film.

## Database

We will be using a database with data about some of Pixar's classic movies for most of our exercises. This first exercise will only involve the Movies table, and the default query below currently shows all the properties of each movie. To continue onto the next lesson, alter the query to find the exact information we need for each task.

The database used for this exercise is [`sqlbolt_movies.db`](../databases/sqlbolt_movies.db).

## Solutions

The query (`.sql`) is present in `/queries` directory if you wanted to run it locally. [exercise1_queries.sql](../queries/exercise1_queries.sql)

### Task 1: Find the `title` of each film
```sql
SELECT title FROM movies;
```
### Task 2: Find the `director` of each film
```sql
SELECT director FROM movies;
```
### Task 3: Find the `title` and `director` of each film
```sql
SELECT title,director FROM movies;
```
### Task 4: Find the `title` and `year` of each film
```sql
SELECT title, year FROM movies;
```
### Task 5: Find `all information` about each film
```sql
SELECT * FROM movies;
```
