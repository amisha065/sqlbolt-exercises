# SQLBolt Exercises Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the exercises provided by [SQLBolt](https://sqlbolt.com/). It is a hands-on SQL practice project focused on building proficiency with SQL queries, using a local SQLite database.

## Project Overview

Each exercise involves solving SQL challenges based on the tables inside the `database` directory 

## Repository Structure

- **databases/**: Contains the SQLite database files used for practicing the exercises.
- **solutions/**: Contains Markdown files(`.md`) with the task, explanations and solutions for each exercise.
- **queries/**:  Contains `.sql` files with queries for each exercise for direct execution locally.
- **setup.md**: Contains detailed instructions on how to set up the environment to run the exercises locally on VSCode.

## How to Use

1. **Read SETUP.md**:
- SETUP.md contains instuctions to setup the entire development evnviorment locally (needs Ubuntu and VSCode)
- **Database Setup:**: Go to the `databases/` folder to find the SQLite database that is used for a particular exercises. For example for `exercise1_solution.md`, `sqlbolt_movies.db` database was used.
- **View Solutions:**: The SQL solutions are available in the `solutions/` directory, with each exercise in a separate Markdown file, e.g., `exercise1_solution.md`.
